Hello, I'm a aspiring Cybersecurity Analyst graduated with a Bachelor of Science in Information Technology, Concentration in Cybersecurity, from George Mason University in December 2024. I bring strong hands-on experience in SIEM tools (Splunk), phishing analysis, threat intelligence, and vulnerability scanning. Skilled in monitoring security events, conducting incident response, and applying industry-standard frameworks such as MITRE ATT&CK, Lookheed CyberKill Chain, and NIST 800-53. Demonstrates a proactive approach to learning and problem-solving with practical lab experience in simulated SOC environments and real-world tools. Committed to contributing to a secure digital landscape through teamwork, technical expertise, and continuous professional development.

## Objective

My goal is to secure an entry-level Cybersecurity Analyst or SOC Analyst position where I can apply my technical skills and knowledge of security monitoring, incident response, and threat intelligence to protect organizational assets. My goal is to grow within a dynamic security operations or IT security team while advancing toward specialized roles in incident response, malware analysis, threat hunting, and digital forensics.
